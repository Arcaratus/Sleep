##Development Setup

1. Fork this project to your own Github repository and clone it to your desktop.
2. Navigate to the directory you cloned to. Open a command window there and run `gradlew setupDevWorkspace` then (if you use Eclipse) `gradlew eclipse` or (if you use IDEA) `gradlew idea`. 
3. This process will setup [Forge](http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/), your workspace, and link [MineTweaker](http://minetweaker3.powerofbytes.com/) as a dependency.
4. Open the project in your IDE of choice.
5. Set `../src/api/java` as a source directory.

####IntelliJ IDEA extra steps

##Custom Builds

**Custom builds are *unsupported*. If you have an issue while using an unofficial build, it is not guaranteed that you will get support.**

####How to make a custom build:

1. Clone directly from this repository to your desktop.
2. Navigate to the directory you cloned to. Open a command window there and run `gradlew build`
3. Once it completes, your new build will be found at `../build/libs/BloodArsenal-*.jar`. You can ignore the `deobf`, `sources`, jars.

##Installation Instructions

This mod requires "Minecraft Forge" in order to operate. It is incredibly easy to download and set up, so might as well get to it!

1. Download [Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/). Usually "Recommended" is best - you want the "universal", not the source. Forge also has an "install" option now, so all you need to do is launch that program and it will make a lovely Forge profile. If you haven't, look up how to use the installer and the new 1.6.x launcher if you are confused!

2. Download the latest version of BloodMagic from [Curseforge](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/blood-magic).

3. Place the mod in the **mods** folder of your .minecraft. If you are unsure of where that is located, it is here: `../Users/you/AppData/roaming/.minecraft`.
